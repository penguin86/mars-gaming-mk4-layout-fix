# Mars Gaming MK4 keyboard layout fix
Fixes inverted period and comma case in all locales having M key followed by , and . keys (I.E: Italian).
The keyboard normally outputs ; instead of , and : instead of . when SHIFT is not pressed.
This script addresses the problem. Meant to be run at startup (i.e. in intr.d or similar).

## Installation
First, run the script to confirm it is working for your config:
```./mars-gaming-mk4-layout-fix.sh```

Then, if working, "install" it with:
```cp mars-gaming-mk4-layout-fix.sh /usr/local/bin/mars-gaming-mk4-layout-fix.sh```

Last step is to [add it to automatic startup execution](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-automatically-execute-shell-script-at-startup-boot-on-systemd-linux)
